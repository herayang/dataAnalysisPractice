# Data Analysis Practice (Pandas/Python/Seaborn)


 # Overview 

This is a project to practice answering questions and plotting data from dataFrame using Python. I've used matplotlib and seaborn for plotting the data. Please check pokemon_analysis.md for summary of what I have learned; codes used to find the answers can be found in the pkmnanaylsis.py file.
